* This is the data for my blog!

It is automatically transformed by [[http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll][Jekyll]] into a static site hosted at [[https://sritchie.github.io]] whenever I push this repository to GitHub.

* Publishing

First, install the required gems:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
gem install jekyll redcarpet
#+END_SRC

- =jekyll --server --auto= at the command line to host the site at [[http://localhost:4000]]. This configuration will automatically pick up changes made to the site's html files (when you regenerate html from org, for example).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x customize-themes ;; disable theme!
C-c x sam ;; (in blog)
M-x customize-themes ;; select "zenburn"
#+END_SRC

To actually get content on to http://sritchie.github.io, push to the master branch.
