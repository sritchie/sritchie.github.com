I'm Sam Ritchie, A [clojure](http://clojure.org/) developer on Twitter's Platform team living in San Francisco, CA. I've developed a number of successful iOS games, including [Rush Hour](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rush-hour/id336542036?mt=8) and [Solitaire Chess](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/solitaire-chess-by-thinkfun/id400116606?mt=8).

I'm currently working on an update to [FORMA](http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/forestmonitoringforactionforma), a system for monitoring deforestation activity in the tropics. We make heavy use of [Cascalog](https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog).
