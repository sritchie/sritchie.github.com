I'm Sam Ritchie, A Scala developer on Twitter's Revenue team living in San Francisco, CA. I've developed a number of successful iOS games, including [Rush Hour]("http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rush-hour/id336542036?mt=8") and [Solitaire Chess](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/solitaire-chess-by-thinkfun/id400116606?mt=8")

I'm currently working on an update to [FORMA](https://github.com/reddmetrics/forma-clj"), a system for monitoring deforestation activity in the tropics. We make heavy use of [Cascalog](https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog).
