* Introducing Pallet-Hadoop

I'm excited to announce [[https://github.com/pallet/pallet-hadoop][Pallet-Hadoop]], a configuration library written in Clojure for Apache's [[http://hadoop.apache.org/][Hadoop]].

In the tutorial, we're going to see how to create a three node Hadoop cluster on EC2, and run a word count on MapReduce. We'll be following along with [[https://github.com/pallet/pallet-hadoop-example][Pallet-Hadoop example project]] for the introduction; for a more in-depth discussion of the design of pallet-hadoop, see the [[https://github.com/pallet/pallet-hadoop/wiki][project wiki]].

** Background

Hadoop is an Apache java framework that allows for distributed processing of enormous datasets across large clusters. It combines a computation engine based on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce][MapReduce]] with [[http://hadoop.apache.org/hdfs/docs/current/hdfs_design.html][HDFS]], a distributed filesystem based on the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_File_System][Google File System]].

Abstraction layers such as [[https://github.com/cwensel/cascading][Cascading]] (for Java) and [[https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog][Cascalog]] (for [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]]) make writing MapReduce queries quite nice. Indeed, running hadoop locally with cascalog [[http://nathanmarz.com/blog/introducing-cascalog-a-clojure-based-query-language-for-hado.html][couldn't be easier]].

Unfortunately, graduating one's MapReduce jobs to the cluster level isn't so easy. Amazon's [[http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/][Elastic MapReduce]] is a great option for getting up and running fast; but what to do if you want to configure your own cluster?

After surveying existing tools, I decided to write my own layer over [[https://github.com/pallet/pallet][Pallet]], a wonderful cloud provisioning library written in Clojure. Pallet runs on top of [[https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds][jclouds]], which allows pallet to define its operations independent of any one cloud provider. Switching between clouds involves a change of login credentials, nothing more.

** Setting Up

Before you get your first cluster running, you'll need to [[https://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html][create an AWS account]]. Once you've done this, navigate to [[http://aws.amazon.com/account/][your account page]] and follow the "Security Credentials" link. Under "Access Credentials", you should see a tab called "Access Keys". Note down your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for future reference.

I'm going to assume that you have some basic knowledge of clojure, and know how to get a project running using [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][leiningen]] or [[https://github.com/ninjudd/cake][cake]]. Go ahead and clone [[https://github.com/pallet/pallet-hadoop-example][the example project]] to follow along:

#+begin_src sh
  $ git clone git://github.com/pallet/pallet-hadoop-example.git
  $ cd pallet-hadoop-example  
#+end_src


Open up =./src/pallet-hadoop-example/core.clj= with your favorite text editor. =example-cluster= contains a data description of a full hadoop cluster with:

- One master node functioning as jobtracker and namenode
- Two slave nodes (=(slave-group 2)=), each acting as datanode and tasktracker.

Start a repl:

#+begin_src sh
$ lein repl
 user=> (use 'pallet-hadoop-example.core) (bootstrap)
#+end_src

** Compute Service

Pallet abstracts away details about specific cloud providers through the idea of a "compute service". The combination of our cluster definition and our compute service will be enough to get our cluster running. We define a compute service at our REPL like so:

#+begin_src clojure
  user=> (def ec2-service
           (compute-service "aws-ec2"
                            :identity "ec2-access-key-id" ;; Swap in your access key ID
                            :credential "ec2-secret-access-key")) ;; Swap in your secret key
  #'pallet-hadoop-example.core/ec2-service
#+end_src

Alternatively, if you want to keep these out of your code base, save the following to =~/.pallet/config.clj=:


#+begin_src clojure
(defpallet
  :services {:aws {:provider "aws-ec2"
                   :identity "your-ec2-access-key-id"
                   :credential "your-ec2-secret-access-key"}})
#+end_src

and define =ec2-service= with:

#+begin_src clojure
user=> (def ec2-service (compute-service-from-config-file :aws))
#'user/ec2-service
#+end_src

** Booting the Cluster

Now that we have our compute service and our cluster defined, booting the cluster is as simple as the following:

#+begin_src clojure
user=> (create-cluster example-cluster ec2-service)
#+end_src

The logs you see flying by are Pallet's SSH communications with the nodes in the cluster. On node startup, Pallet uses your local SSH key to gain passwordless access to each node, and coordinates all configuration using streams of SSH commands.

Once =create-cluster= returns, we're done! We now have a fully configured, multi-node Hadoop cluster at our disposal.

** Running Word Count

To test our new cluster, we're going log in and run a word counting MapReduce job on a number of books from [[http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page][Project Gutenberg]].

Point your browser to the [[https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/][EC2 Console]], log in, and click "Instances" on the left.

You should see three nodes running; click on the node whose security group contains "jobtracker", and scroll the lower pane down to retrieve the public DNS address for the node. It'll look something like =ec2-50-17-103-174.compute-1.amazonaws.com=. I'll refer to this address as =jobtracker.com=.

Point your browser to =jobtracker.com:50030=, and you'll see the JobTracker web console. (Keep this open, as it will allow us to watch our MapReduce job in action.).=jobtracker.com:50070= points to the NameNode console, with information about HDFS.

Next, we'll SSH into the jobtracker, and operate as the =hadoop= user. Head to your terminal and run the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
$ ssh jobtracker.com # insert actual address, enter yes to continue connecting
$ sudo su - hadoop
#+end_src

** Copy Data to HDFS

At this point, we're ready to begin following along with Michael Noll's excellent [[http://goo.gl/aALr9][Hadoop configuration tutorial]]. (I'll cover some of the same ground for clarity.)

Our first step will be to collect a bunch of text to process. We start by downloading the following seven books to a temp directory:

- [[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/20417/pg20417.txt][The Outline of Science, Vol. 1 (of 4) by J. Arthur Thomson]]
- [[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5000/pg5000.txt][The Notebooks of Leonardo Da Vinci]]
- [[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4300/pg4300.txt][Ulysses by James Joyce]]
- [[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/132/pg132.txt][The Art of War by 6th cent. B.C. Sunzi]]
- [[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1661/pg1661.txt][The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]
- [[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/972/pg972.txt][The Devilâ€™s Dictionary by Ambrose Bierce]]
- [[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/19699/pg19699.txt][Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th Edition, Volume 4, Part 3]]

Running the following commands at the remote shell should do the trick.

#+begin_src sh
$ mkdir /tmp/books
$ cd /tmp/books
$ curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/20417/pg20417.txt
$ curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/5000/pg5000.txt
$ curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4300/pg4300.txt
$ curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/132/pg132.txt
$ curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1661/pg1661.txt
$ curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/972/pg972.txt
$ curl -O http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/19699/pg19699.txt
#+end_src

Next, navigate to the Hadoop directory:

#+begin_src sh
$ cd /usr/local/hadoop-0.20.2/
#+end_src

And copy the books over to the distributed filesystem:

#+begin_src sh
  /usr/local/hadoop-0.20.2$ hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal /tmp/books books
  /usr/local/hadoop-0.20.2$ hadoop dfs -ls
  Found 1 items
  drwxr-xr-x   - hadoop supergroup          0 2011-06-01 06:12:21 /user/hadoop/books
  /usr/local/hadoop-0.20.2$ 
#+end_src

** Running MapReduce

We're ready to run the MapReduce job. =wordcount= takes an input path within HDFS, processes all items within, and saves the output to HDFS -- to =books-output=, in this case. Run this command:

#+begin_src sh
/usr/local/hadoop-0.20.2$ hadoop jar hadoop-examples-0.20.2-cdh3u0.jar wordcount books/ books-output/
#+end_src

And you should see something very similar to this:

#+begin_src sh

/usr/local/hadoop-0.20.2$ 
#+end_src

** Retrieving Output

Now that the MapReduce job has completed successfully, all that remains is to extract the results from HDFS and take a look.

#+begin_src sh
$ mkdir /tmp/books-output
$ hadoop dfs -getmerge books-output /tmp/books-output
$ head /tmp/books-output/books-output
#+end_src

You should see something very close to:

#+begin_src text
"'Ah!'	2
"'Ample.'	1
"'At	1
"'But,	1
"'But,'	1
"'Come!	1
"'December	1
"'For	1
"'Hampshire.	1
"'Have	1
#+end_src

Success!

** Killing the Cluster

When we're finished, we can kill our cluster with this command, back at the REPL:

#+begin_src clojure
user=> (destroy-cluster example-cluster ec2-service)
#+end_src

** Next Installment

That's it for now! Next, we'll talk about how to test hadoop clusters using pallet-hadoop with [[https://github.com/tbatchelli/vmfest][vmfest]] to create a virtual machine cluster identical to your production cluster on the cloud.
