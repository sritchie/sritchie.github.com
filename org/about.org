I'm Sam Ritchie, A [[http://clojure.org/][clojure]] developer on Twitter's Platform team living in San Francisco, CA. I've developed a number of successful iOS games, including [[http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rush-hour/id336542036?mt=8][Rush Hour]] and [[http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/solitaire-chess-by-thinkfun/id400116606?mt=8][Solitaire Chess]].

I'm currently working on an update to [[http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/forestmonitoringforaction][FORMA]], a system for monitoring deforestation activity in the tropics. We make heavy use of [[https://github.com/nathanmarz/cascalog][cascalog]].
